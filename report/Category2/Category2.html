                  This section of the report contains research questioning data that details the test participants' user experience. This research was conduceted on the participants in interview form after a 5-15 minute interaction with the website.   </p>
                  <p class="pb-2">

                    The bullet points below represent different participants answers to the same interview question.  </p>
                
                <h4> What are you thinking as you first view this main page? </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                 • It is a very confusing webpage design layout, but I see a lot of vehicles with numbers, so I guess it’s a vehicle selling website. </p>
                 
                
                <h4> If you were looking for a toys section, where would you expect to find it?  </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • Well, I can see there is a menu on the side of the screen but it’s not English, and I can’t see a language changing option. I would just have to guess.  </p>
                
                <h4> How was the experience of using the product?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • Disorienting and I didn’t like it.   </p> 
                    
                <h4> [Probe:] How easy or difficult was it to navigate?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • Very difficult because the layout is unusual; I can see a menu but the rest is just a jumble of random vehicles and strange products. 
                </p>
                 
                <h4> [Probe:] What are your thoughts on the design and layout?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                 • Unusual, unappealing, confusing. It’s too disorganised and random.   </p>
                  <h4> [Internal] How long did it take the user to complete this task?  </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • 3 minutes. </p>
                  <h4> How would you describe your overall experience with the product?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • It was a pretty poor experience overall, It took me a while to figure out how to use it, and the layout and design is one of the worst and confusing that I've ever seen.   </p>
                  <h4> What did you like the most about using this product?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • Well it was unique experience at least, but I can’t think of too many positives about the website.  </p>
                  <h4> What did you like the least?     </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • The layout and general organisation of the whole thing.  </p>
                  <h4> What, if anything, surprised you about the experience?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                 • I have never been on a website this badly designed and confusingly jumbled.   </p>
                  <h4> What, if anything, caused you frustration?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • The organisation and layout, and the fact that I could change the language to English to even read the tiny menu on the side.    </p>
                  <h4> On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = not at all likely, 5 = very likely), how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • 0, as it’s barely usable.   </p>
