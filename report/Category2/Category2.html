                  This section of the report contains research questioning data that details the test participants' user experience. This research was conduceted on the participants in interview form after a 5-15 minute interaction with the website.   </p>

                 Participant 1: It is a very confusing webpage design layout, but I see a lot of vehicles with numbers, so I guess it’s a vehicle selling website. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Participant 2: It is very chaotic. The color pallete does not fit nicely with each toerh. The fonts are also very chaotic, as some
                 vary in size, making it inconsistent.
               </p>
                 

                 • It is a very confusing webpage design layout, but I see a lot of vehicles with numbers, so I guess it’s a vehicle selling website.
                 <br><br>
                 • The webpage is extremely overwhelming to look at, it's very hard to identify the name, price and picture associate with one item.
                </p>

                
                <h4> If you were looking for a toys section, where would you expect to find it?  </h4>

                <h4> How was the experience of using the product?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  Participant 1: Disorienting and I didn’t like it.

                  <br>
                  Participant 2: Too difficult to navigate, very chaotic.
                </p> 
                    

                  • Well, I can see there is a menu on the side of the screen but it’s not English, and I can’t see a language changing option. I would just have to guess.
                  <br><br>
                  • The only way I can see to do this is by using the search bar at the top of the webpage.

                  <br><br>
                  • There is to much information to take in at once so overall it was not a good experience.
                 </p>

                <h4> [Probe:] How easy or difficult was it to navigate?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  • Very difficult because the layout is unusual; I can see a menu but the rest is just a jumble of random vehicles and strange products. 
                  <br><br>
                  • Impossible to navigate, I was unsure about what I could and couldn't click on. 
                 </p>
                 
                <h4> [Probe:] What are your thoughts on the design and layout?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                 • Unusual, unappealing, confusing. It’s too disorganised and random.  
                 <br><br>
                  • Design is plain and layout doesn't make any sense.
                 </p>

                <p class="pb-3">

                  • 3 minutes. 
                  <br><br>
                  • 4 minutes.
                 </p>
                  <h4> How would you describe your overall experience with the product?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">


                  Participant 1: It was a pretty poor experience overall, It took me a while to figure out how to use it, and the layout and design is one of the worst and confusing that I've ever seen. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Participant 2: Not satisfied with it. Don't know where to look. Very messy and chaotic.

                  <h4> What did you like the most about using this product?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  Participant 1: Well it was unique experience at least, but I can’t think of too many positives about the website.
                  <br> 
                  <br>
                  Particpant 2: The yoda figurine. No clue why its on there. Theres also pictures of random people on bikes.
                   </p>
                  <h4> What did you like the least?     </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  Participant 1: The layout and general organisation of the whole thing. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Participant 2: The layout. There are multiple search buttons in random places, I think they should be just placed
                  on the corner. There are items on the top that should be down somewhere else, instead of where the heading should be. It
                  is also hard to determine who is the target audience, cause the content varies widely.
                   </p>
                  <h4> What, if anything, surprised you about the experience?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                 Participant 1: I have never been on a website this badly designed and confusingly jumbled.  
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Participant 2: The amount of content. There is too much going on, and it's not straight forward enough.
                  </p>
                  <h4> What, if anything, caused you frustration?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  Participant 1: The organisation and layout, and the fact that I could change the language to English to even read the tiny menu on the side.   
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Participant 2: No target demographic. Why are there adult products being advertised together with children's toys.
                   </p>
                  <h4> On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = not at all likely, 5 = very likely), how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?   </h4>
                <p class="pb-3">

                  Participant 1: 0, as it’s barely usable.   
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Participant 2: 1. I might rate it a 5 just to mess around with someone

                  • The search bar is the most user friendly feature on the website, so that would be what I like the most.
