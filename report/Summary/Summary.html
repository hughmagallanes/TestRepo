                My major is software development and I have very minimal experience in this industry aside from a small few personal projects,
                as well as assignments. I believe this research project went as well as we hoped for. The data that we received from the participants
              were sufficient enough to make solid conclusions as to what people expect when interacting with an unfamiliar website. I learnt how to
            conduct a good research process, to get the best data possible suited for a research about usability tests. I will most definitely use this
            as learning experience for conducting future research.</td>

                  <b>What I did:</b><br>
                  My team and I surveyed users of various age groups around us for reviews and experiences on specific websites and conducted usability studies on the interaction between well-designed and provided web pages. Usability testing was conducted with three participants from different classes and designed to examine the three criteria for web pages' efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction so that they could complete certain tasks.<br><br>
                  
                  <b>How I did that:</b><br>
                  Our team members began to conceptualize the results of the web page. It is important to identify the features of a webpage that are potentially useful or inconvenient to use. Therefore, we wrote a realistic scenario and based on the questionnaire, participants compared their familiar web pages with the web pages provided, looked at the responses, and conducted interviews.<br><br>
                  
                  As a software developer, I have conducted usability tests several times in previous academic courses. Therefore, I knew the direction and method of the basic test, and I prepared the questions before the test. We prepared many practical questions from the participant's points of view to make the participants participate more in the survey, and the participants did their job very well. Moreover, when I compared their feedback with the results I thought, I found that a lot of them matched. 
                  By conducting this usability test, I could synthesize more objective reviews of people and understand the differences, not just my thoughts about a particular object or environment.

                <td colspan="3">When conducting this testing report, I had a role in usability data collection (interview questions) and usability data presentation.<br><br>   

When reflecting on the testing itself, we intended to follow iterative and informal principles (Dumas, 1999). This ensured a clear and relaxed environment in which the participants conducted their usability testing, providing more precise product feedback and data.<br><br> 

Participant selection also had to be considered for this specific type of product. Unlike paid software, a website is a free-to-access product, which brings a unique set of standards. Furthermore, due to the universal nature of the Internet, a target market can be demographically broad, which also presents a broad range of expectations to consider. Additionally, diversity in web browsing hardware is extensive, resulting in a variety of website experiences (A.Edmonds, 2003).<br><br>  

This was my first practical usability testing experience (AUT & industry), and when considering my software development major, this report demonstrated the value that usability testing gives to a client or development team. Usability testing is necessary to create a system that works with, not against, the user. An appealing layout design is crucial to the user experience, and not meeting the users’ standards can severely impede their overall experience.<br><br>    </td>

                  For this usability test I was assigned the role of facilitating a participant through a selection of tasks
                  while observing and collecting data on the usability of a website based on the participants experience.<br><br>  

                  To ensure the best results, I removed distractions and allowed my participant to fully engage while they attempted
                  to interact with the webpage and its features. To help ensure reliable results, I did not tell my participant 
                  how to use the webpage as this would affect the accuracy of test results. 

                  Overall, I think our usability test was successful and if we were developing this website, I would have 
                  sufficient data to correct design flaws which according to our usability test would be detrimental to a
                  user’s overall experience.<br><br>  

                  I’m studying computer science majoring in software development, currently my only experience in this
                   industry are my personal projects. This is the first time I have performed a usability test and it has
                    backed up my personal opinions on what would need to change in the design of our chosen website. 
                    By seeing a everyday user interact with a program it becomes very clear that the time it takes to 
                    complete a task needs to be minimal as user’s will get frustrated when it takes too long to complete an action.
                     The website is for the user, so it needs to be designed so the majority have minimal if not no issues trying to use it, 
                     by completing usability tests, you allow the developers to achieve such a goal.<br><br>
