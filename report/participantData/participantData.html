                  To sum up the data of our participants, we can safely assume that the website that has been built
                  is not user-friendly. The most common reaction that was being shown was that the website was very 
                  chaotic and hard to navigate. This is a very understandable reaction, as the website does not have a clear structure
                  as to what the website is about or any sort of user-friendliness to it. One participant did
                  state that the website looks very similar to what you would see in a very old magazine print, and 
                  referenced the section of an old magazine that was showing job applications. This was a very
                  interesting insight, as he was stating about how random the website was. Like an old magazine showing
                  vacant job applications, there was no structure to how each job advertisement on a magazine was placed.
                  If there was room, thats where the job advertisement would fit in.

                <h4>Lessons learnt from Participant Research</h4>
                <p class="pb-3"> 
                  We believe that we went about this research to the best of our abilities. We believe we asked
                  all the right questions to get the best information possible out of the participants. We can take
                  this information for future research projects as we now know what kind of questions we would need to ask
                  if we were to get some reliable information out of our research participants.
